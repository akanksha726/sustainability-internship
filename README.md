# Edunet Internship – Sustainable Energy and Efficiency

# 🔋 Predicting Household Energy Consumption using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of my **Edunet Internship on Sustainability, Energy & Efficiency**.  
The goal of the project is to **predict household energy consumption** using **Machine Learning** techniques.  

Energy efficiency plays a crucial role in reducing wastage, lowering carbon footprints, and supporting sustainable living. By predicting energy usage, households and governments can plan better, reduce peak loads, and move towards a greener future.
