# Edunet Internship – Sustainable Energy and Efficiency

This repository contains my internship work for the **Edunet Sustainability Energy and Efficiency program**.  
The Week 1 project focuses on designing a **microgrid with solar + battery storage** and generating synthetic data for analysis.

## What's included
- `Microgrid_Week1.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook with:
  - Problem definition
  - Data generation and preprocessing
  - Training/testing data split
  - Visualizations of load, solar generation, and battery storage

## Why this topic?
Microgrids with renewable energy and storage help improve energy reliability and reduce fossil fuel dependence — making them vital for a sustainable future.

## How to view this project
You can view the notebook directly on GitHub or open it in Google Colab to run the code interactively.
